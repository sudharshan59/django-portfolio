## ✨ Why This Portfolio Stands Out

- 🔧 **Fully Admin-Managed** — Add/edit all content via `/admin` with zero code updates
- 🧠 **Smart Content Showcase** — Skills, Projects, Education, Achievements, and Contact in one place
- 🎨 **Neo Theme** — Deep Navy (#0A192F) + Electric Yellow (#FFD700) with smooth animations
- 📱 **Responsive Design** — Flawless on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- 📊 **Skills Visualization** — Animated progress bars for 15+ technical & soft skills
- 🖼️ **Project Gallery** — Cards with GitHub links + Hugging Face demos
- 🧭 **Dynamic Navbar** — Auto-highlights active section as you scroll
